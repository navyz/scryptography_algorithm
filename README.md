# Implement some cryptography algorithms

The best way to understand the network/internet security is to study the basic fundemental which it is based on. 

Nowaday, people talk alot about the privacy, security, hacking, public private keys... and I feel curious.

After having some research on this topic, I decided to ... master this. And the first step is to understand how the data is encrypt/decrypt, how to add signature to the information and publish it to Internet without worrying someone will try to ... so something funny.

This source code is for study/research purpose. It does not focus on performance but the algorithm itself.

And I does not implement all from scratch (ofcause). Some, i develop myself, and the others I copy here and there on the internet. 

To make sure the things is working correctly, I have unitested every pieces of code very carefully.

Thing is going on. This is just the first step.

BTW, I build this project in QT IDE. If you are familiar with this, life will be easier.
